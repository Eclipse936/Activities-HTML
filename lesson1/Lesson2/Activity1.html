            <h2>Facts About Dogs</h2>
            <p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf. Also
                called the
                domestic dog, it was selectively bred from a population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by
                hunter-gatherers. Dogs
                were the first species to be domesticated over 14,000 years ago, before the development of agriculture.
                Due to their
                long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be
                inadequate for
                other canids.</p>
